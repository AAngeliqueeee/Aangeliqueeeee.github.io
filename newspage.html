<h1>American Black bear seen inside Local Diner!</h1>
<h3>What the workers have to say!</h3>
<p>
   <q> I was just so confused</q> Says Waitress Emily, who just started her shift before the Bear strolled in. <q> I was wiping tables and I look behind me and see a huge bear just staring at me! All I could do was freeze and hope he would go away! One of the scariest days of my Life! </q>
        <h3>Why was the bear in the Diner?</h3>
        <p>
            Scientists have shown studies of abnormal activities of American Black bears in recent years around Colorado, which is where the diner is located. <q>We Haven't figured out the cause of these abnormalizes in the bears recent attitude, but we seem to come to the conclusion that they are becoming more social creatures and among the years grown to get used to humans without much fear or worry</q> States Mr. Malcov, Scientist and researcher at Colorado wildlife sanctuary.

<h3> So what do we think? </h3>

<p>
Our conclusion? <strong> Bears are more social than we think! </strong> Yes, we obviously dont want them in our local diner eating our food right of our plates, but maybe we need to learn to coexist and a safe and healthy environment! stop being scared of these creatures, just open up and give them the affection they crave!
