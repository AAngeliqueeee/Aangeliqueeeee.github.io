        <q>I was just so confused.</q> says waitress Emily, who had just started her shift before the bear strolled in.
        <q>I was wiping tables and I look behind me and see a huge bear just staring at me! All I could do was freeze and hope he would go away! One of the scariest days of my life!</q>

      <h3>Why was the bear in the diner?</h3>
      <p>
        Scientists have shown studies of abnormal activities in American Black Bears in recent years around Colorado, which is where the diner is located.
        <q>We haven't figured out the cause of these abnormalities in the bears’ recent attitude, but we seem to come to the conclusion that they are becoming more social creatures and over the years have grown used to humans without much fear or worry.</q>
        says Mr. Malcov, scientist and researcher at Colorado Wildlife Sanctuary.

      <h3>So what do we think?</h3>
      <p>
        Our conclusion? <strong>Bears are more social than we think!</strong> Yes, we obviously don't want them in our local diner eating food right off our plates, but maybe we need to learn to coexist in a safe and healthy environment. Stop being scared of these creatures — open up and give them the affection they crave!
